## 🌟 What is Isshoni Nihongo?

**Isshoni Nihongo (いっしょに日本語)** — meaning *“Japanese Together”* — is an initiative and student-led club dedicated to promoting the Japanese language and culture in an interactive, engaging, and inclusive way.  

We believe language is more than grammar and vocabulary; it's a gateway to a vibrant world of tradition, innovation, and human connection. Our club strives to create an environment where learners of all levels can **explore Japanese in a collaborative and fun setting** — together.

From cracking JLPT N5 kanji to folding paper cranes, from practicing keigo to screening anime marathons — if it's related to Japan, you'll find it here.
