## What is Isshoni Nihongo❓️

**Isshoni Nihongo (いっしょに日本語)** is more than just a Japanese club — it's a vibrant community of learners, dreamers, and culture enthusiasts who share a love for all things Japan.  
The name _“Isshoni Nihongo”_ literally means _“Japanese Together,”_ and that’s exactly what we’re about — learning together, growing together, and having a great time along the way.

From anime to JLPT, from sushi to shodo (書道) — whether you’re a total beginner or a seasoned learner, there's always something new waiting here for you.

## Who are we? 🌸

We’re students who bonded over our shared passion for Japanese culture, and we decided to take it to the next level.  
We host events, language sessions, and cultural exchanges — all designed to make learning fun and interactive.

Here’s how we roll:

- 🈳 Language Learning: From Hiragana to JLPT prep
- 🎎 Cultural Celebrations: Tanabata, Obon, Setsubun... you name it!
- 📺 Anime Nights & Movie Screenings: Because culture can be binge-watched too
- ✍️ Quizzes, Games & Creative Projects: Engage, explore, and express

If it’s Japanese, we’re on it.  
If it’s fun, we’re doing it.  
If it brings people together, we’re leading it.
